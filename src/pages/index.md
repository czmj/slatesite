I am so glad you’re here!

People come to counselling for many different reasons, and for a lot of us it’s a scary step.
It can mean admitting that we are sad, or stuck, or that something has to change. But it’s
also a brave and hopeful step. For whatever reason you have ended up on my website
today, I hope that I can be of service to you in this next part of your journey.

My name is Slate Powell, and I am an integrative counsellor. I offer online counselling for
people who want things in their life to be different. Here are some of the reasons why you
might be seeking help:
- Depression and low mood
- Anxiety
- Low self esteem and self-confidence
- Bereavement and grief
- Relationships with family, friends or colleagues
- Relationships with romantic partners
- Facing major life changes
- Navigating chronic illness
- Feeling lost, directionless or adrift
- Historic abuse of any kind
- Making difficult decisions
- Wanting to talk about gender, sexuality, or identity in a safe place
- Self-exploration and reflection
- Learning from past experiences
- Just wanting to feel happier

My aim is to offer you a warm, gentle, and authentic presence, so you can tell your story
and be truly heard. A place where you feel supported to explore your thoughts and
feelings. A time that is just for you and your needs and hopes.

I am thankful that you have come here today, and I hope to get to know you better.
